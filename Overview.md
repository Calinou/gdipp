# Font renderer #

Similar to gdi++, multiple font renderers and rasterizers are use internally. [FreeType](http://freetype.sourceforge.net/), which is widely used in Linux world, is the default font renderer of gdipp. Thanks to open-source and universal interface, the whole rendering process in this mode can be controlled completely and more functionality is supported. [GetGlyphOutline](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd144891%28VS.85%29.aspx), a Windows API that retrieves the "appearance" of characters, may provide better compatibility in various situations. However, due to the limited interface, not as many as functionality and performance can be implemented. With appropriate setting, either delivers superseding text appearance to ClearType. Both these two font renderers are also implemented in gdi++ FreeType version.

We are working on implementing [DirectWrite](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd368038%28VS.85%29.aspx) as the third font renderer in gdipp. ClearType is an collection of APIs that provides extensive functions on high-quality text rendering and layouting. We hope to deliver superior looking and performance (by enabling hardware accelerating) than GetGlyphOutline.
